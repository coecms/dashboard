        This dashboard was developed and maintained by the CMS team at the ARC Centre of Excellence
        for Climate Extremes. On the 20th of December 2024 this dashboard will be shut down due to 
        the CoE ceasing operations. The dashboard runs on third-party cloud infrastructure, 
        and therefore cannot be left running due to the ongoing costs of hosting. As such, no new 
        projects will be added to this dashboard from this point on, and some projects may be removed 
        without notice.
